# CalC Calculator ➕➖➗

## My Goal

The objective of this project was to build a hybrid calculator application using JavaScript & React-Native. The calculator performs all the basic arithmetic operations on both integer and float type values. The calculator also stores the calculation history of the user for future reference. The history can be cleared at once using a clear button. The application is compatible on various platforms like Android, iOS, and Web.
